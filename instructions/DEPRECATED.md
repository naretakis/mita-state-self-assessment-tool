# 🚨 INSTRUCTIONS FOLDER DEPRECATED

## Migration to Kiro Specs Complete

This `instructions/` folder has been **fully migrated** to comprehensive Kiro specifications and is now **deprecated**.

## ✅ Where to Find Current Documentation

### **For Development Work:**
- **📋 Kiro Specs**: `.kiro/specs/` - Complete requirements, design, and implementation tasks
- **🎯 Kiro Steering**: `.kiro/steering/` - Development standards and architectural guidelines
- **🔧 Kiro Hooks**: `.kiro/hooks/` - Automated quality checks and development workflows

### **For Project Overview:**
- **📖 README.md** - Updated project overview and setup instructions
- **📝 CHANGELOG.md** - Version history and recent changes

## 🗂️ Content Migration Map

| Old Instructions File | New Kiro Location | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `index.md` | `.kiro/steering/project-context.md` | ✅ Migrated |
| `architecture.md` | `.kiro/steering/architecture-guidelines.md` | ✅ Migrated |
| `mita_framework.md` | `.kiro/specs/content-management-system/` | ✅ Migrated |
| `assessment_workflow.md` | `.kiro/specs/assessment-workflow/` | ✅ Migrated |
| `data_models.md` | Multiple specs (storage, content, etc.) | ✅ Migrated |
| `development_guide.md` | `.kiro/steering/development-workflow.md` | ✅ Migrated |
| `prompt_library.md` | Replaced by actionable Kiro tasks | ✅ Migrated |

## 🎯 Why We Migrated

### **Kiro Specs Provide:**
1. **Actionable Tasks** - 58 specific implementation tasks vs. general guidance
2. **Requirements Traceability** - Clear requirements → design → tasks mapping
3. **Automated Workflows** - Hooks for quality gates and documentation
4. **Better Organization** - Feature-based organization vs. document-based
5. **Implementation Focus** - Specific coding tasks vs. general descriptions

### **Instructions Folder Limitations:**
1. **Static Documentation** - No actionable tasks or automation
2. **Maintenance Overhead** - Duplicate information across files
3. **No Traceability** - Hard to track what's implemented vs. documented
4. **Generic Guidance** - Not specific to current implementation needs

## 📅 Deprecation Timeline

- **✅ Phase 1 Complete**: All content migrated to Kiro specs
- **✅ Phase 2 Complete**: README updated to point to Kiro specs
- **🔄 Phase 3 Current**: Instructions folder marked as deprecated
- **📋 Phase 4 Planned**: Remove instructions folder in future release

## 🚀 Getting Started with Kiro

### **For New Team Members:**
1. Read `.kiro/steering/project-context.md` for project overview
2. Review `.kiro/steering/architecture-guidelines.md` for technical architecture
3. Browse `.kiro/specs/` to understand feature requirements and implementation status

### **For Development Work:**
1. Use `.kiro/specs/*/tasks.md` files to see what needs to be implemented
2. Run Kiro hooks for quality checks and automated workflows
3. Follow steering file guidelines for coding standards and practices

### **For Project Management:**
1. Track progress using Kiro spec task completion status
2. Use hooks for automated quality assurance
3. Reference requirements and design documents for feature planning
