# Documentation Standards and Maintenance

## Documentation Structure

The project maintains documentation in three key areas:
1. **README.md** - Project overview, setup instructions, and usage guide
2. **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history, feature additions, and bug fixes
3. **instructions/** - Comprehensive development documentation and context

## Documentation Update Requirements

### When Implementing Features
- Update README.md with new functionality descriptions
- Add entry to CHANGELOG.md with feature details
- Update relevant instruction files if architecture or workflow changes
- Include screenshots or examples for user-facing features

### When Fixing Bugs
- Add bug fix entry to CHANGELOG.md
- Update README.md if the fix affects user instructions
- Revise instruction files if the bug revealed process gaps

### When Refactoring Code
- Update architecture.md if structural changes are made
- Revise development_guide.md for new patterns or practices
- Update data_models.md if data structures change

## Documentation Quality Standards

### README.md Requirements
- Clear project description and purpose
- Up-to-date installation and setup instructions
- Current feature list with status indicators
- Usage examples and screenshots
- Contribution guidelines
- License and contact information

### CHANGELOG.md Format
Follow semantic versioning and conventional changelog format:
```markdown
## [Version] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- New features and capabilities

### Changed
- Changes to existing functionality

### Fixed
- Bug fixes and corrections

### Removed
- Deprecated or removed features
```

### Instructions Folder Maintenance
- Keep technical documentation current with implementation
- Update code examples to match actual codebase
- Revise architectural decisions when patterns change
- Maintain consistency between instruction files

## Automated Documentation Checks

Documentation should be validated for:
- Broken internal links between files
- Outdated code examples or screenshots
- Missing entries for recent changes
- Consistency with actual implementation
- Proper markdown formatting and structure

## Documentation Review Process

Before releasing features or fixes:
1. Review all affected documentation files
2. Verify examples and instructions are current
3. Check that new features are properly documented
4. Ensure changelog entries are complete and accurate
5. Validate that README reflects current project state
