# Requirements Document - Content Management System

## Introduction

The Content Management System feature enables the MITA State Self-Assessment Tool to load, parse, and manage MITA capability definitions from YAML/Markdown files. This feature implements the content-code separation principle, allowing subject matter experts to update capability definitions without code changes while providing the application with structured data for assessments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a subject matter expert, I want to define MITA capability areas within domains using YAML/Markdown files, so that I can update capability definitions without requiring code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN capability area definitions are stored in YAML/Markdown format THEN the system SHALL parse front matter metadata and markdown content separately
2. WHEN capability files follow the naming convention [domain]-[capability-area].md THEN the system SHALL automatically discover and load them from the public/content directory
3. WHEN capability area definitions include ORBIT dimensions THEN the system SHALL parse and structure outcome, role, business process, information, and technology dimension data for each capability area
4. IF capability files have invalid YAML front matter THEN the system SHALL log parsing errors and provide fallback content handling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a ContentService that provides structured access to capability data, so that I can build assessment workflows without directly handling file parsing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ContentService loads THEN the system SHALL provide methods to retrieve capability areas by ID, domain, or capability area name
2. WHEN requesting capability area data THEN the system SHALL return structured TypeScript interfaces with type safety
3. WHEN capability area content is requested THEN the system SHALL provide both metadata and parsed markdown content
4. IF content loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an application user, I want capability content to load efficiently, so that I can navigate through assessments without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading for capability area content to optimize initial load time
2. WHEN capability area content is accessed THEN the system SHALL cache parsed content in memory with appropriate TTL
3. WHEN multiple capability areas are requested THEN the system SHALL batch load related content to minimize network requests
4. IF content is large THEN the system SHALL implement progressive loading with loading indicators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want content validation and error handling, so that invalid content doesn't break the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing capability area files THEN the system SHALL validate required fields and data structure integrity
2. WHEN content validation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and continue with valid content
3. WHEN markdown parsing encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide fallback rendering and error boundaries
4. IF critical content is missing THEN the system SHALL display meaningful error messages to users and provide recovery options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content maintainer, I want content versioning and consistency checks, so that I can ensure all capability area definitions follow the same structure and standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content files are loaded THEN the system SHALL validate consistent heading structure and required sections
2. WHEN ORBIT dimensions are defined THEN the system SHALL ensure all five dimensions (outcome, role, business process, information, technology) are present
3. WHEN content includes cross-references THEN the system SHALL validate that referenced capability areas exist
4. IF content structure is inconsistent THEN the system SHALL provide detailed validation reports and suggestions for fixes
