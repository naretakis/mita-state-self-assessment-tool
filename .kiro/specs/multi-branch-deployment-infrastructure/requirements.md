# Requirements Document - Multi-Branch Deployment Infrastructure

## Introduction

The Multi-Branch Deployment Infrastructure feature provides a robust, automated deployment system that supports multiple isolated environments on GitHub Pages. This feature enables parallel development workflows with production, development, and testing environments that can be deployed and maintained independently while preserving existing deployments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployment to multiple environments (production, dev, test), so that I can maintain isolated environments for different stages of development and testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN the system SHALL automatically deploy to the production environment at the root path
2. WHEN code is pushed to dev branch THEN the system SHALL automatically deploy to the development environment at /dev/ path
3. WHEN code is pushed to test branch THEN the system SHALL automatically deploy to the test environment at /test/ path
4. IF deployment to any environment fails THEN the system SHALL preserve existing deployments and provide detailed error reporting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment isolation with proper base path configuration, so that each environment functions independently without cross-environment interference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for different environments THEN the system SHALL configure appropriate base paths and asset prefixes for each environment
2. WHEN deploying to subdirectories THEN the system SHALL ensure proper routing and asset loading for client-side navigation
3. WHEN environments are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide correct 404 handling and fallback routing for each environment
4. IF base path configuration fails THEN the system SHALL use fallback configurations and log configuration errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want content preservation during deployments, so that deploying to one environment doesn't affect other environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to any environment THEN the system SHALL preserve existing content from other environments
2. WHEN artifact download is available THEN the system SHALL use GitHub Actions artifacts to preserve site structure
3. WHEN artifacts are unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to downloading existing site content from live URLs
4. IF content preservation fails THEN the system SHALL log warnings and continue with available content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want deployment validation and monitoring, so that I can ensure deployments are successful and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployments complete THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging of the deployment process and final site structure
2. WHEN deployments are in progress THEN the system SHALL show clear progress indicators and status updates
3. WHEN deployment errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with actionable troubleshooting information
4. IF deployment validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and provide specific failure reasons

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible deployment triggers and manual deployment options, so that I can control when and how deployments occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using workflow_dispatch THEN the system SHALL allow manual deployment triggers for any supported branch
2. WHEN deployments are triggered THEN the system SHALL support deployment to specific environments without affecting others
3. WHEN concurrent deployments are attempted THEN the system SHALL use proper concurrency controls to prevent conflicts
4. IF manual deployment is requested for unsupported branches THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and supported options
