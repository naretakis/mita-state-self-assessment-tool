  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 6.2, 6.3_

- [ ] 3. Simplify Next.js configuration
  - Update `next.config.js` to remove multi-environment logic
  - Configure single base path for production deployment
  - Set asset prefix to match base path
  - Ensure static export settings are correct
  - Remove any dev/test environment-specific configurations
  - Verify distDir is set to 'out' for GitHub Pages compatibility
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

  - Delete old GitHub Actions workflow files for multi-branch deployment
  - Remove any deployment scripts in the repository
  - Remove environment-specific build scripts
  - Clean up any dev/test branch configuration files
  - Search codebase for references to dev/test environments and remove them
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 5. Update project documentation
  - Update README.md with simplified deployment instructions
  - Remove all references to dev/test environments from README
  - Add section explaining GitHub Pages deployment process
  - Update CHANGELOG.md with deployment simplification changes
  - Update CONTRIBUTING.md to reflect single-branch workflow
  - Remove multi-branch deployment references from all documentation
  - Add troubleshooting section for common deployment issues
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 6. Create GitHub Pages configuration guide
  - Document step-by-step GitHub Pages setup instructions
  - Include screenshots or detailed steps for repository settings
  - Document required settings (branch: main, HTTPS enforcement)
  - Create verification checklist for GitHub Pages configuration
  - Add troubleshooting guide for common configuration issues
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 7. Test deployment workflow locally
  - Run `npm run build` with production environment variables
  - Verify build output in `out/` directory
  - Check that all assets have correct base path prefixes
  - Test that build completes without errors
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 6.1, 6.5_

- [ ] 8. Configure GitHub Pages in repository settings
  - Navigate to repository Settings > Pages
  - Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
  - Select main branch as deployment source
  - Enable HTTPS enforcement
  - Save configuration and verify settings
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 9. Deploy and verify the simplified workflow
  - Commit all changes to a feature branch
  - Run quality checks (`npm run check`)
  - Create pull request with deployment simplification changes
  - Merge to main branch to trigger deployment
  - Monitor GitHub Actions workflow execution
  - Verify deployment completes successfully
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 6.3, 6.4_

- [ ] 10. Verify deployed application
  - Visit deployed site at GitHub Pages URL
  - Test navigation between key pages
  - Verify assets (CSS, JS, images) load correctly
  - Check browser console for errors
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 4.3, 6.3_

- [ ] 11. Update ROADMAP.md to reflect completion
  - Mark Phase 1.1 (Deployment Simplification) as complete
  - Mark Phase 1.2 (Repository Organization) as complete
  - Update status and completion dates
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 5.5_

- [ ] 12. Archive multi-branch deployment spec
  - Move `multi-branch-deployment-infrastructure` to `archived-done/`
  - Update any references to the archived spec
  - _Requirements: 5.3, 5.5_

- [ ] 13. Final cleanup and documentation review
  - Review all documentation for consistency
  - Ensure all deployment references are up to date
