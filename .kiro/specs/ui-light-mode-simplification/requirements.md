# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on simplifying the MITA State Self-Assessment Tool's UI by ensuring consistent light mode styling throughout the application and removing any dark mode complexity. The goal is to reduce maintenance overhead, improve consistency, and ensure all UI elements display correctly with proper contrast ratios for accessibility compliance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the MITA assessment tool, I want a consistent light mode interface throughout the application, so that I have a predictable and accessible user experience without visual inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads any page of the application THEN the system SHALL display all content using light mode styling
2. WHEN a user navigates between different sections of the application THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent light mode colors and styling
3. WHEN a user interacts with any UI component THEN the system SHALL ensure all elements use the same light mode color palette
4. WHEN a user views the application on different devices THEN the system SHALL maintain light mode consistency across all screen sizes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the MITA assessment tool, I want a simplified theming system with only light mode support, so that I can reduce code complexity and maintenance overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL contain no dark mode related code, variables, or styling
2. WHEN examining CSS files THEN the system SHALL use a single, consistent set of color variables for light mode
3. WHEN looking at component implementations THEN the system SHALL not include theme switching logic or dark mode conditionals
4. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL not include unused dark mode assets or styles in the bundle

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want all UI elements to have proper contrast ratios in light mode, so that I can easily read and interact with all content regardless of my visual capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN measuring text contrast THEN the system SHALL ensure all text meets WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
2. WHEN examining interactive elements THEN the system SHALL ensure buttons, links, and form controls have sufficient contrast ratios
3. WHEN testing focus indicators THEN the system SHALL provide clearly visible focus states that meet accessibility standards
4. WHEN reviewing status indicators THEN the system SHALL ensure success, warning, and error states have appropriate contrast

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the assessment tool, I want all UI components to be visually consistent and properly styled, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing different components THEN the system SHALL use consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes from the CMS Design System
2. WHEN examining form elements THEN the system SHALL ensure all inputs, buttons, and controls follow the same styling patterns
3. WHEN looking at cards, alerts, and other UI elements THEN the system SHALL maintain visual consistency across all components
4. WHEN testing responsive behavior THEN the system SHALL ensure all components maintain proper styling at different screen sizes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working on the MITA assessment tool, I want clear and consolidated styling architecture, so that I can easily understand and modify the UI without introducing inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the styles directory THEN the system SHALL have a clear hierarchy of CSS files with defined purposes
2. WHEN reviewing CSS variables THEN the system SHALL use a consistent naming convention and organization
3. WHEN looking at component styles THEN the system SHALL follow established patterns for styling implementation
4. WHEN adding new components THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidelines for maintaining styling consistency
