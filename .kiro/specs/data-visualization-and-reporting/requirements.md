# Requirements Document - Data Visualization and Reporting

## Introduction

The Data Visualization and Reporting feature provides comprehensive visualization and export capabilities for MITA assessment results. This feature enables state users to view their assessment outcomes through interactive charts, generate detailed reports, and export data in multiple formats for analysis and sharing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a state user, I want to view my assessment results through interactive charts, so that I can quickly understand my system's maturity levels across different capability areas and ORBIT dimensions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing assessment results THEN the system SHALL display a bar chart showing overall maturity scores for each capability area
2. WHEN viewing assessment results THEN the system SHALL display a radar chart comparing ORBIT dimension scores across capability areas
3. WHEN interacting with charts THEN the system SHALL provide tooltips with detailed score information and capability area names
4. IF assessment data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL display partial results with clear indicators for missing data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a state user, I want to export my assessment results as a PDF report, so that I can share comprehensive results with stakeholders and maintain official records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting PDF export THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report including assessment metadata, summary tables, and detailed results
2. WHEN generating PDF reports THEN the system SHALL include assessment information (state name, creation date, status) in the header
3. WHEN PDF export includes details THEN the system SHALL provide capability-by-capability breakdown with maturity levels, evidence, and notes
4. IF PDF generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and alternative export options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a state user, I want to export my assessment data as CSV, so that I can perform additional analysis using spreadsheet tools or import into other systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting CSV export THEN the system SHALL generate structured data with headers for domain, capability area, overall score, and individual dimension scores
2. WHEN generating CSV data THEN the system SHALL include all assessment metadata and calculated maturity scores
3. WHEN CSV export is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically download the file with a descriptive filename including state name and date
4. IF CSV generation encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide fallback export options and error recovery

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a state user, I want real-time calculation of maturity scores, so that I can see immediate feedback as I complete assessments and understand my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assessment data changes THEN the system SHALL automatically recalculate overall and dimension-specific maturity scores
2. WHEN calculating scores THEN the system SHALL handle incomplete assessments by using appropriate default values or indicators
3. WHEN displaying calculated scores THEN the system SHALL round scores to one decimal place for readability
4. IF score calculations fail THEN the system SHALL display error indicators and provide manual refresh options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a state user, I want customizable export options, so that I can generate reports tailored to different audiences and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initiating export THEN the system SHALL provide options to include or exclude detailed assessment data
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL allow users to choose whether to include chart visualizations in PDF exports
3. WHEN customizing exports THEN the system SHALL remember user preferences for future export operations
4. IF export customization options are invalid THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults and notify users of any adjustments
