# Requirements Document - Accessibility and Performance

## Introduction

The Accessibility and Performance feature ensures the MITA State Self-Assessment Tool meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards and provides optimal performance across all supported browsers and devices. This feature implements comprehensive accessibility features, performance optimizations, and cross-browser compatibility testing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a state user with disabilities, I want the assessment tool to be fully accessible via keyboard navigation and screen readers, so that I can complete assessments independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating with keyboard only THEN the system SHALL provide clear focus indicators and logical tab order through all assessment steps
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels, descriptions, and announcements for all interactive elements
3. WHEN accessing form controls THEN the system SHALL provide clear labels, instructions, and error messages that are accessible to assistive technologies
4. IF focus management is needed THEN the system SHALL maintain proper focus during step transitions and modal interactions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a state user, I want the assessment tool to load quickly and respond smoothly, so that I can complete assessments efficiently without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading the application THEN the system SHALL achieve initial page load in under 3 seconds on standard broadband connections
2. WHEN navigating between assessment steps THEN the system SHALL respond within 500ms for all user interactions
3. WHEN working with large assessments THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive performance with 50+ capability areas
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide loading indicators and maintain user feedback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a state user on different devices, I want the assessment tool to work consistently across browsers and screen sizes, so that I can use my preferred device and browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) THEN the system SHALL provide identical functionality and appearance
2. WHEN accessing on tablet devices THEN the system SHALL provide touch-optimized interactions and responsive layout
3. WHEN using different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain readability and usability from 768px to 1920px width
4. IF browser features are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide graceful fallbacks without losing core functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a state user with visual impairments, I want sufficient color contrast and text sizing options, so that I can read and interact with the assessment content clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any content THEN the system SHALL maintain minimum 4.5:1 color contrast ratio for normal text and 3:1 for large text
2. WHEN text is displayed THEN the system SHALL support browser zoom up to 200% without horizontal scrolling or content loss
3. WHEN color is used to convey information THEN the system SHALL provide additional non-color indicators (icons, text, patterns)
4. IF users have color vision deficiencies THEN the system SHALL remain fully functional and understandable

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a state user, I want the assessment tool to work efficiently even with slow internet connections, so that I can complete assessments regardless of my network conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using slow connections THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical content loading and provide offline functionality
2. WHEN network is intermittent THEN the system SHALL queue operations and retry automatically when connectivity is restored
3. WHEN bandwidth is limited THEN the system SHALL optimize asset loading and provide progressive enhancement
4. IF network fails completely THEN the system SHALL maintain functionality with cached content and local storage
