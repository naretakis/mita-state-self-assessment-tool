# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the review and improvement of the newly implemented assessment header and sidebar components. The changes include a new sticky header with progress tracking, save status, and navigation, plus a collapsible sidebar with assessment navigation and progress indicators. This review aims to ensure the implementation follows our coding standards, accessibility guidelines, and architectural patterns while identifying areas for improvement.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer reviewing the codebase, I want to ensure the new header and sidebar components follow our established coding standards and architectural patterns, so that the code is maintainable and consistent with the rest of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the component code THEN all components SHALL follow TypeScript best practices with proper type definitions
2. WHEN examining the code structure THEN components SHALL be properly organized with clear separation of concerns
3. WHEN checking imports and exports THEN all unused imports SHALL be removed and proper import ordering SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN reviewing styling THEN CSS-in-JS patterns SHALL be consistent with existing components
5. WHEN examining error handling THEN components SHALL implement proper error boundaries and graceful degradation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the header and sidebar to be fully accessible, so that I can navigate and use the assessment tool effectively with assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL be focusable and have proper focus indicators
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN all elements SHALL have appropriate ARIA labels and roles
3. WHEN examining color contrast THEN all text SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements
4. WHEN testing with assistive technologies THEN navigation SHALL be logical and intuitive
5. WHEN using reduced motion preferences THEN animations SHALL respect user preferences

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the header and sidebar to work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports, so that I can use the assessment tool on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the sidebar SHALL be collapsible and maintain state
2. WHEN viewing on tablet THEN the layout SHALL adapt appropriately with touch-friendly interactions
3. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the sidebar SHALL transform to an overlay with proper backdrop
4. WHEN resizing the viewport THEN components SHALL respond smoothly without layout breaks
5. WHEN interacting on touch devices THEN all buttons SHALL have appropriate touch targets

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user taking an assessment, I want clear visual feedback about my progress and save status, so that I understand where I am in the process and whether my work is being saved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN progressing through an assessment THEN the header SHALL display accurate completion percentage
2. WHEN data is being saved THEN the save status SHALL show "Saving..." with appropriate visual indicator
3. WHEN data is saved THEN the save status SHALL show "Saved" with timestamp
4. WHEN there are unsaved changes THEN the save status SHALL indicate "Not saved"
5. WHEN viewing progress THEN the sidebar SHALL show per-capability completion status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want comprehensive documentation and tests for the new components, so that future changes can be made safely and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN all new components SHALL have comprehensive JSDoc comments
2. WHEN running tests THEN all new components SHALL have unit tests with good coverage
3. WHEN checking documentation THEN README and CHANGELOG SHALL be updated with new features
4. WHEN reviewing integration THEN components SHALL integrate properly with existing error handling
5. WHEN examining performance THEN components SHALL not introduce performance regressions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user navigating through an assessment, I want intuitive navigation controls that help me understand the assessment structure and move between sections efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the sidebar THEN capability areas SHALL be clearly grouped with progress indicators
2. WHEN expanding capability sections THEN dimension steps SHALL be visible with completion status
3. WHEN clicking navigation items THEN the current step SHALL be clearly highlighted
4. WHEN using the dashboard button THEN navigation SHALL return to the main dashboard
5. WHEN accessing results THEN there SHALL be a clear path to view assessment results
