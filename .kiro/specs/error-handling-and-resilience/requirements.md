# Requirements Document - Error Handling and Resilience

## Introduction

The Error Handling and Resilience feature ensures the MITA State Self-Assessment Tool provides robust error handling, graceful degradation, and data protection mechanisms. This feature implements comprehensive error boundaries, storage error handling, and recovery mechanisms to prevent data loss and provide excellent user experience even when errors occur.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a state user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully without losing my assessment data, so that I can continue working even when technical issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs in any component THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message without crashing the entire application
2. WHEN an error boundary catches an error THEN the system SHALL log error details for debugging while showing recovery options to the user
3. WHEN a component error occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve user data and provide options to retry or continue with alternative functionality
4. IF an error prevents normal operation THEN the system SHALL offer data export options to prevent data loss

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a state user, I want clear feedback when storage operations fail, so that I can take appropriate action to protect my assessment data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browser storage limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL notify the user with specific guidance on resolving the issue
2. WHEN storage operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide immediate export options for current assessment data
3. WHEN storage corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery and provide fallback options
4. IF storage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL warn users and provide alternative data persistence methods

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a state user, I want the application to recover from errors automatically when possible, so that I can continue my assessment without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a recoverable error occurs THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic recovery with user notification
2. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL queue operations and retry when connectivity is restored
3. WHEN component state becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL reset to a known good state while preserving user data
4. IF automatic recovery fails THEN the system SHALL provide manual recovery options with clear instructions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a state user, I want comprehensive error logging and reporting, so that technical issues can be identified and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including context and user actions
2. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide error reporting mechanisms for technical support
3. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL track recovery success rates and common error patterns
4. IF users encounter repeated errors THEN the system SHALL provide escalated support options and workarounds
