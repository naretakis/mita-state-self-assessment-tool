# Requirements Document - Storage and Data Management

## Introduction

The Storage and Data Management feature provides robust, client-side data persistence for MITA assessment data using a tiered storage approach. This feature implements localStorage as the primary storage mechanism with IndexedDB as a fallback for larger datasets, ensuring reliable data persistence across browser sessions while maintaining optimal performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a state user, I want my assessment data to be automatically saved to browser storage, so that I don't lose my work if I close the browser or encounter technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters assessment data THEN the system SHALL automatically save the data to browser storage using the preferred storage mechanism
2. WHEN localStorage is available and sufficient THEN the system SHALL use localStorage as the primary storage method
3. WHEN localStorage is unavailable or insufficient THEN the system SHALL automatically fall back to IndexedDB storage
4. IF both storage mechanisms fail THEN the system SHALL notify the user and provide export options to prevent data loss

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a state user, I want automatic save functionality every 30 seconds, so that my progress is continuously protected without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is actively working on an assessment THEN the system SHALL automatically save changes every 30 seconds
2. WHEN auto-save is triggered THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating save status (saving, saved, error)
3. WHEN auto-save encounters errors THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and notify the user of persistent failures
4. IF auto-save is disabled by user preference THEN the system SHALL provide manual save options and warn about potential data loss

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a state user, I want to manage multiple assessments with reliable data persistence, so that I can work on different assessments without data conflicts or loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating multiple assessments THEN the system SHALL store each assessment with unique identifiers and prevent data conflicts
2. WHEN loading assessment lists THEN the system SHALL retrieve all stored assessments with metadata (creation date, status, progress)
3. WHEN switching between assessments THEN the system SHALL preserve the state of each assessment independently
4. IF assessment data becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery and provide backup options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a state user, I want storage quota management and optimization, so that I can continue working even when browser storage limits are approached.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storage usage approaches limits THEN the system SHALL notify users with specific guidance on managing storage space
2. WHEN storage quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL provide options to delete old assessments or export data to free space
3. WHEN large assessments are stored THEN the system SHALL implement data compression and chunking to optimize storage usage
4. IF storage optimization fails THEN the system SHALL provide alternative storage options and data export capabilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a state user, I want data export and import capabilities, so that I can backup my assessments and transfer them between devices or browsers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting assessment data THEN the system SHALL generate complete data packages including all assessment information and metadata
2. WHEN importing assessment data THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and merge with existing assessments without conflicts
3. WHEN data export is requested THEN the system SHALL provide multiple format options (JSON, encrypted backup) with clear descriptions
4. IF import data is invalid or corrupted THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and partial import options where possible
