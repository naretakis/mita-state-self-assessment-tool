  - Add methods for dimension scoring, capability scoring, and level advancement detection
  - Include comprehensive error handling for missing or invalid checkbox data
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 2. Update Field Labels in DimensionAssessment Component
  - Replace generic "Maturity Details" field labels with specific names
  - Update labels to: "Supporting Description", "Barriers and Challenges", "Outcomes-Based Advancement Plans", "Additional Notes"
  - Ensure labels are used consistently in form fields, accessibility attributes, and help text
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 3. Enhance DimensionAssessment with Level Advancement Prompts
  - Add logic to detect when all checkboxes in a maturity level are completed
  - Display user-friendly message prompting consideration of next higher maturity level
  - Implement message styling that integrates with existing design system
  - Add accessibility support for screen readers to announce level advancement suggestions
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 1.5_

- [ ] 4. Add Real-time Score Display to DimensionAssessment
  - Integrate scoring service to calculate and display current dimension score
  - Show score updates in real-time as users check/uncheck boxes
  - Display both base maturity level and partial credit earned from checkboxes
  - Add visual indicators showing score calculation breakdown
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 5. Enhance AssessmentResults with Partial Credit Scoring
  - Update calculateMaturityScores function to use enhanced scoring service
  - Modify score display to show both base scores and partial credit
  - Update charts and visualizations to reflect enhanced scoring calculations
  - Ensure backward compatibility with existing assessments that lack checkbox data
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 6. Add Expandable Detail Sections to AssessmentResults
  - Implement collapsible sections for each capability area in results display
  - Show detailed assessment responses and selected checkboxes when expanded
  - Add clear indicators of which maturity level was selected for each dimension
  - Include checkbox completion status and contribution to partial credit
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6_

- [ ] 7. Enhance AssessmentSidebar with Real-time Scoring
  - Add score calculation and display logic to sidebar progress indicators
  - Show numerical scores next to completion checkmarks for completed ORBIT dimensions
  - Implement real-time score updates as users make changes during assessment
  - Format scores to two decimal places and ensure proper accessibility labeling
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 8. Implement Data Management for Unselected Maturity Levels
  - Add visual indicators to show when data exists in unselected maturity levels
  - Ensure only selected maturity level data contributes to scoring calculations
  - Implement clear separation between preserved data and scoring-relevant data
  - Add warnings or notifications about unselected data that won't affect final scores
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6_

- [ ] 9. Update Export Functionality with Enhanced Scoring
  - Modify PDF and CSV export functions to include enhanced scoring information
  - Show both base maturity levels and partial credit in exported reports
  - Include checkbox completion details in detailed export options
  - Ensure exported data clearly indicates which maturity level was selected
  - _Requirements: 2.6, 4.5_

- [ ] 10. Add Comprehensive Error Handling and Validation
  - Implement error handling for scoring calculation failures
  - Add validation for checkbox data integrity and corruption detection
  - Create fallback mechanisms for missing checkbox definitions
  - Ensure graceful degradation when enhanced scoring features are unavailable
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 11. Create Unit Tests for Enhanced Scoring System
  - Write comprehensive tests for scoring service calculations including edge cases
  - Test component behavior with various checkbox states and data conditions
  - Verify backward compatibility with existing assessments
  - Test real-time score updates and level advancement prompts
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 3.1_

- [ ] 12. Integrate and Test Complete Enhanced Scoring Workflow
  - Test end-to-end workflow from checkbox selection to results display
  - Verify that all components work together correctly with enhanced scoring
  - Test data persistence and loading with enhanced scoring data
  - Ensure accessibility compliance for all new scoring features
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2_
