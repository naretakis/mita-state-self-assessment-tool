# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MITA State Self-Assessment Tool has basic PDF and CSV export functionality in the assessment results page, but it does not capture all user inputs and generated content comprehensively. The current export functionality is missing key data elements and lacks format options that would improve data portability, backup capabilities, and preparation for future import functionality. This enhancement focuses specifically on improving the export functionality available on the assessment results page by adding comprehensive data capture, new export formats (Markdown and JSON), and enhanced user experience while maintaining the current single-location access pattern.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a state Medicaid agency user, I want to export my complete assessment data with all missing metadata and content, so that I can preserve my work comprehensively and prepare for future import functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates an export THEN the system SHALL capture all assessment metadata including state name, system name (currently missing), creation date, last updated date, and last saved timestamp (currently missing)
2. WHEN exporting assessment data THEN the system SHALL include all domain and capability area selections and progress indicators (partially implemented)
3. WHEN exporting maturity level data THEN the system SHALL include selected maturity levels, detailed checkbox selections with individual checkbox states, and partial credit calculations for each ORBIT dimension
4. WHEN exporting user-generated content THEN the system SHALL include all text entered in Supporting Attestation, Barriers and Challenges, Outcomes-Based Advancement Plans, and Additional Notes fields in all export formats (currently only in PDF details)
5. WHEN exporting assessment results THEN the system SHALL include calculated scores, visualizations data representation, and assessment completion status with progress percentages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a state Medicaid agency user, I want to export my assessment data in Markdown format, so that I can easily read, edit, and version control my assessment documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects Markdown export THEN the system SHALL generate a well-structured Markdown document with proper headings and formatting
2. WHEN generating Markdown export THEN the system SHALL include assessment metadata in a front matter section using YAML format
3. WHEN creating Markdown content THEN the system SHALL organize content hierarchically by domain, capability area, and ORBIT dimension
4. WHEN including user text content THEN the system SHALL preserve formatting and line breaks from the original input
5. WHEN displaying maturity levels THEN the system SHALL use clear formatting to show selected levels and checkbox completion status
6. WHEN including scores THEN the system SHALL present both base maturity scores and enhanced scores with partial credit in a readable format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a state Medicaid agency user, I want to export my assessment data in JSON format, so that I can ensure complete data preservation and enable reliable import functionality in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects JSON export THEN the system SHALL generate a complete JSON representation of the assessment data structure
2. WHEN creating JSON export THEN the system SHALL include all data fields with proper typing and null handling
3. WHEN exporting JSON data THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity between related data elements
4. WHEN generating JSON format THEN the system SHALL include schema version information for future compatibility
5. WHEN creating JSON export THEN the system SHALL ensure the format is suitable for reliable import functionality
6. WHEN handling complex data types THEN the system SHALL serialize dates, arrays, and nested objects appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a state Medicaid agency user, I want to export my assessment data in PDF format, so that I can create professional reports for sharing with stakeholders and official documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects PDF export THEN the system SHALL generate a professionally formatted PDF document with proper typography and layout
2. WHEN creating PDF content THEN the system SHALL include assessment metadata in a header or title section
3. WHEN generating PDF format THEN the system SHALL include data visualizations (charts and graphs) as embedded images
4. WHEN organizing PDF content THEN the system SHALL use clear section breaks and hierarchical formatting for readability
5. WHEN including user text content THEN the system SHALL preserve formatting and ensure proper page breaks
6. WHEN creating PDF export THEN the system SHALL include page numbers, table of contents, and professional styling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a state Medicaid agency user, I want to export my assessment data in an enhanced CSV format that includes all text content, so that I can analyze the complete data in spreadsheet applications and integrate with other data analysis tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects CSV export THEN the system SHALL generate a structured CSV file with clear column headers including all text fields (currently missing barriers, plans, notes)
2. WHEN creating CSV format THEN the system SHALL flatten hierarchical data into a tabular structure with appropriate column naming for all content fields
3. WHEN exporting to CSV THEN the system SHALL handle text fields with commas and line breaks by proper escaping or quoting for all user-generated text content
4. WHEN generating CSV data THEN the system SHALL include separate rows for each ORBIT dimension assessment with complete text content
5. WHEN creating CSV export THEN the system SHALL include calculated scores, completion percentages, and checkbox completion details as numeric columns
6. WHEN handling complex data THEN the system SHALL represent individual checkbox selections and their states in a CSV-compatible format

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a state Medicaid agency user, I want to access enhanced export functionality from the assessment results page, so that I can easily export my complete assessment data in multiple formats after reviewing my results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing assessment results THEN the system SHALL provide enhanced export options with all format choices (currently limited to PDF and CSV)
2. WHEN accessing export functionality THEN the system SHALL present a clear interface for selecting export format and options including the new Markdown and JSON formats
3. WHEN initiating export THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback and success confirmation (currently implemented)
4. WHEN export is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger file download with improved filename conventions that include system name and timestamps
5. WHEN using the export interface THEN the system SHALL provide clear descriptions of each export format and its intended use case
6. WHEN export functionality is accessed THEN the system SHALL maintain the current user experience while adding the new format options seamlessly

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a state Medicaid agency user, I want export files to have meaningful names and be organized logically, so that I can easily manage multiple assessment exports over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating export files THEN the system SHALL use filename conventions that include assessment name, system name, and export date
2. WHEN creating filenames THEN the system SHALL sanitize special characters and ensure compatibility across operating systems
3. WHEN exporting multiple formats THEN the system SHALL use consistent base filenames with appropriate file extensions
4. WHEN generating export files THEN the system SHALL include timestamp information in ISO format for sorting and organization
5. WHEN creating export filenames THEN the system SHALL limit filename length to ensure compatibility with file systems
6. WHEN handling duplicate exports THEN the system SHALL append version numbers or timestamps to prevent overwrites

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a state Medicaid agency user, I want the export functionality to handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback, so that I can understand and resolve any issues that occur during export.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN export functionality encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display clear, user-friendly error messages
