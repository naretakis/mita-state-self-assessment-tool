## 1 Document Overview

### 1.1 Document Purpose

The Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA) 4.0 Capability Reference Model defines the proposed MITA framework for classifying the necessary capabilities to support a State Medicaid Agency (SMA). This document communicates the proposed Capability framework and gathers feedback from stakeholders.

Once the proposed Capability framework has been reviewed and approved, it will be combined with and aligned to other MITA 4.0 reference models developed by the SS-A and MITA NextGen workgroups to create a comprehensive MITA 4.0 Reference Model for publication.

### 1.2 Audience

The primary audience for this document includes but is not limited to:

- MITA 4.0 NextGen Members
- MITA 4.0 SS-A Workgroup Members
- MITA Governance Board
- Medicaid (MESC) MITA 4.0 Workshop Participants

## 2 Model Overview

### 2.1 Model Objective

The MITA 4.0 Capability Reference Model is a key component of the MITA 4.0 Framework. The primary objective of the reference model is to support the alignment, leverage, reuse, and interoperability of MITA-related capabilities across SMAs.

### 2.2 Model Definition

A capability is defined as an ability that an SMA possesses or seeks to develop to achieve its goals and meet its desired outcomes. It represents what the SMA can do without attempting to explain how, why, or where the SMA uses the capability. The ability may exist within the SMA today or may be required to enable a new direction or achieve a new desired outcome.

Each capability in the framework consists of the following elements:

- **Outcomes** — The desired outcomes that require the capability for their achievement
- **Roles** — The individual roles responsible for providing the capability
- **Business Processes** — The business processes performed to deliver the capability
- **Information** — The information and the data management capabilities needed to deliver the capability
- **Technology** — The technology for automating, scaling, and supporting the capability

#### MITA 3.0 vs. MITA 4.0 Capabilities

MITA 3.0 defines capabilities as the competence of an individual, organization, or system to perform a function or process. The MITA 4.0 framework redefines capabilities by removing the concept of competence. In MITA 4.0, a capability focuses only on the ability that an SMA possesses or seeks to develop: MITA 4.0 is agnostic of how well the SMA performs a capability.

The purpose of the state self-assessment in MITA 4.0 is to assess the maturity of the capability and how well the SMA performs the capability based on the outcomes, roles, business processes, information, and technology that an SMA has defined and implemented to support that capability.

The Capability Domains and Capability Areas in MITA 4.0 closely align to the following concepts in MITA 3.0:

- MITA 3.0 Business Areas and Business Categories
- MITA 3.0 Technical Service Areas and Classifications

### 2.3 Model Structure

A capability reference model is an abstract framework that defines concepts for grouping capabilities that share a common meaning. This reference model establishes a shared definition of capability concepts that cross organizational boundaries and helps identify opportunities for sharing, leverage, and reuse.

The MITA 4.0 Capability Reference Model identifies the key capability concepts for supporting the Medicaid Program and achieving the MITA 4.0 goals and outcomes. The structure consists of two levels:

- **Capability Domain** — High-level capability used to group common capabilities
- **Capability Area** — Detailed capabilities that decompose the capability domain into sub-capabilities that SMAs can use to classify their capabilities. There are one-to-many distinct Capability Areas for each Capability Domain.

### 2.4 Model Application

SMAs will use the MITA 4.0 Capability Reference Model to classify their own capabilities. SMAs will define their specific capabilities to meet their own distinct needs based on the capability domains and capability areas in the reference model. The reference model enables alignment of capabilities across SMAs. The model makes it possible for states and CMS to:

- Identify opportunities to collaborate, leverage, and reuse state capabilities
- Consistently assess and report capability maturity

### 2.5 Model Contents

The MITA 4.0 Capability Reference Model organizes capability domains that an SMA possesses or seeks to develop into three distinct layers:

- **Strategic** — Capabilities that enable an SMA to establish and maintain their enterprise strategy
- **Core** — Capabilities that enable an SMA to meet their mission and achieve their desired outcomes
- **Support** — Capabilities that are not specific to an SMA's mission but are critical for its core and strategic capabilities

### Data Management Capability Domain

The Data Management Capability Domain represents the SMA's ability to manage its data. The domain encompasses key data management capability areas organized into two areas:

- **Foundational** — Data management capability areas that all other data management capability areas depend on and are critical for successfully managing data. These foundational capabilities provide oversight and structure to ensure data is fit for use and accessible to the right people.
- **Lifecycle** — Data management capability areas that support the management of data through one or more phases of its lifecycle. These capability areas support data through planning, design, use, enhancement, enablement, and maintenance.

SMAs use the Data Management Capabilities to support the following functions:

- **Classify Data Management Needs** — Provides a common vocabulary for classifying data management needs within and across SMAs
- **Identify Data Management Needs** — Provides a common vocabulary for describing the type of data management capabilities to support a business capability
- **Identify Data Management Solutions** — Illuminates opportunities to leverage, reuse, improve data within an SMA
- **Assessing Data Management Maturity** — Supports assessment of an SMA's maturity to manage data

#### Information vs. Data Management

The Data Management Capability model makes a distinction between managing data and managing information. Data management refers to the key capabilities for managing any type of data. Information management, on the other hand, is business focused and involves managing specific types of information from a business perspective.
