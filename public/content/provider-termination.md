## Capability Domain: Provider

The Provider capability domain encompasses three related areas; Provider Enrollment, Provider Management, and Provider Termination. 

## Capability Area: Provider Termination

Provider Termination encompasses the processes and systems used to manage the end of provider participation in the Medicaid program, including voluntary terminations, terminations for cause, payment suspensions, and appeals management. This capability area aligns with CMS-Required outcomes PM5 (Termination), PM7 (Appeal), PM15 (Sanctions and Terminations), and PM18 (Payment Suspension).

## Outcomes

### Description
The Outcomes dimension focuses on the results and effectiveness of the provider enrollment process.

### Maturity Level Assessment

#### Level 1: Initial
Manual provider termination process with paper-based documentation and limited tracking of termination reasons. Basic appeals management with minimal automation. Limited sharing of termination information with other programs.

#### Level 2: Repeatable
Basic electronic termination process with standardized documentation and categorization of termination reasons. Structured appeals workflow with manual tracking. Basic reporting of termination information to other states and Medicare.

#### Level 3: Defined
Fully electronic termination process with automated workflow and comprehensive tracking of termination reasons. Integrated appeals management system with status tracking and notification. Automated sharing of termination information with other states and Medicare.

#### Level 4: Managed
Intelligent termination workflow with automated business rules for termination conditions. Advanced appeals management with case analytics and decision support. Comprehensive information sharing with real-time updates to other programs and systems.

#### Level 5: Optimized
Continuous monitoring for termination conditions with proactive identification of potential issues. Integrated appeals management with predictive analytics and outcome tracking. Real-time bidirectional information sharing across states and federal programs with automated synchronization.

## Roles

### Description
The Roles dimension addresses the responsibilities and interactions of staff and providers in the enrollment process.

### Maturity Level Assessment

#### Level 4: Managed
Automated assignment of tasks based on expertise, cross-trained staff with decision support tools, and collaborative enrollment teams.

#### Level 5: Optimized
Dynamic role assignment based on enrollment complexity, continuous learning systems support staff decisions, with seamless coordination across programs and agencies.

## Business Processes

### Description
The Business Processes dimension covers the workflows, procedures, and operational aspects of provider enrollment.

### Maturity Level Assessment

#### Level 1: Initial
Manual, paper-based workflow with sequential processing steps and limited tracking of application status.

#### Level 2: Repeatable
Basic electronic workflow with some automated validations, though manual intervention is required for most steps.

#### Level 3: Defined
Fully electronic workflow with parallel processing where possible and automated tracking and notifications.

#### Level 4: Managed
