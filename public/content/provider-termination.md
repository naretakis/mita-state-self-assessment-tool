## Capability Domain: Provider

The Provider capability domain encompasses three related areas; Provider Enrollment, Provider Management, and Provider Termination. 

## Capability Area: Provider Termination

Provider Termination encompasses the processes and systems used to manage the end of provider participation in the Medicaid program, including voluntary terminations, terminations for cause, payment suspensions, and appeals management. This capability area aligns with CMS-Required outcomes PM5 (Termination), PM7 (Appeal), PM15 (Sanctions and Terminations), and PM18 (Payment Suspension).

## Outcomes

### Description
The Outcomes dimension focuses on the results and effectiveness of the provider termination process.

### Maturity Level Assessment

#### Level 1: Initial
Manual provider termination process with paper-based documentation and limited tracking of termination reasons. Basic appeals management with minimal automation. Limited sharing of termination information with other programs.

#### Level 2: Repeatable
Basic electronic termination process with standardized documentation and categorization of termination reasons. Structured appeals workflow with manual tracking. Basic reporting of termination information to other states and Medicare.

#### Level 3: Defined
Fully electronic termination process with automated workflow and comprehensive tracking of termination reasons. Integrated appeals management system with status tracking and notification. Automated sharing of termination information with other states and Medicare.

#### Level 4: Managed
Intelligent termination workflow with automated business rules for termination conditions. Advanced appeals management with case analytics and decision support. Comprehensive information sharing with real-time updates to other programs and systems.

#### Level 5: Optimized
Continuous monitoring for termination conditions with proactive identification of potential issues. Integrated appeals management with predictive analytics and outcome tracking. Real-time bidirectional information sharing across states and federal programs with automated synchronization.

## Roles

### Description
The Roles dimension addresses the responsibilities and interactions of staff and providers in the termination process.

### Maturity Level Assessment

#### Level 1: Initial
Provider termination specialists manually process applications with limited provider self-service capabilities and siloed responsibilities across termination steps.

#### Level 2: Repeatable
Providers can submit applications online, staff roles are focused on specific verification tasks, with limited coordination between termination teams.

#### Level 3: Defined
Provider self-service for most termination functions, specialized staff handle exceptions and complex cases, with coordinated roles across termination workflow.

#### Level 4: Managed
Automated assignment of tasks based on expertise, cross-trained staff with decision support tools, and collaborative termination teams.

#### Level 5: Optimized
Dynamic role assignment based on termination complexity, continuous learning systems support staff decisions, with seamless coordination across programs and agencies.

## Business Processes

### Description
The Business Processes dimension covers the workflows, procedures, and operational aspects of provider termination.

### Maturity Level Assessment

#### Level 1: Initial
Manual, paper-based workflow with sequential processing steps and limited tracking of application status.

#### Level 2: Repeatable
Basic electronic workflow with some automated validations, though manual intervention is required for most steps.

#### Level 3: Defined
Fully electronic workflow with parallel processing where possible and automated tracking and notifications.

#### Level 4: Managed
Intelligent workflow with adaptive routing, automated exception handling, and predictive workload management.

#### Level 5: Optimized
Continuous process optimization with cross-program termination coordination and real-time adaptation to regulatory changes.

## Information

### Description
The Information dimension addresses the data, data models, and information management aspects of provider termination.

### Maturity Level Assessment

#### Level 1: Initial
Basic provider demographic information with manual verification of credentials and limited data sharing between systems.

#### Level 2: Repeatable
Structured provider data model with electronic storage of supporting documentation and basic interfaces with external verification sources.

#### Level 3: Defined
Comprehensive provider data model with automated data validation rules and integration with multiple verification sources.

#### Level 4: Managed
Enhanced data model supporting advanced analytics, real-time data validation and enrichment, and comprehensive provider risk profile.

#### Level 5: Optimized
Dynamic data model adapting to changing requirements, continuous data quality monitoring, and seamless information sharing across programs.

## Technology

### Description
The Technology dimension covers the systems, infrastructure, and technical capabilities supporting provider termination.

### Maturity Level Assessment

#### Level 1: Initial
Legacy systems with limited integration, manual data entry and verification, and minimal automation.

#### Level 2: Repeatable
Basic web forms for provider termination, document management system, and limited system integration.

#### Level 3: Defined
Integrated provider termination system, automated workflow management, and API-based integration with verification sources.

#### Level 4: Managed
Cloud-based termination platform, advanced analytics and decision support, and comprehensive API ecosystem.

#### Level 5: Optimized
