  Technical Architecture maturity criteria assess the technology infrastructure, integration, 
  platform services, application architecture, security, operations, and development practices 
  that support Medicaid Enterprise Systems.

# Overall Technology maturity level definitions
overallLevels:
  level1:
    name: Initial
    description: >
      The State operates a monolithic, legacy MMIS with little modernization or capability 
      to interact with other systems as evidenced by limited modularity, reuse, or interoperability. 
      Integrations occur through direct connections, using proprietary formats and batch file transfers. 
      Security practices are fragmented; compliance processes are manual with limited automation.
  level2:
    name: Developing
    description: >
      The State has begun modularizing core Medicaid functions (e.g., eligibility and claims) and 
      piloting standards-based APIs (e.g., NIEM and HL7). Non-critical modules are piloted in SaaS 
      environments; security policies exist but lack centralized enforcement. The state is implementing 
      modular components and piloting cloud solutions and standards, but it lacks overall enterprise 
      integration.
  level3:
    name: Defined
    description: >
      Core Medicaid systems are modularized with standardized service contracts and interoperable 
      APIs aligned with CMS and national standards (e.g., FHIR, HL7, and X12). A hybrid cloud model 
      supports scalability and modernization, with a cloud-first policy for new modules. State runs 
      a modular, standards-based Medicaid enterprise that aligns with CMS's requirements for 
      modularity and interoperability.
  level4:
    name: Managed
    description: >
      The Medicaid Enterprise is governed as a cohesive platform with real-time interoperability 
      across modules, MCOs, HIEs, and CMS. Performance metrics are actively monitored and used for 
      continuous improvement. Most of the Medicaid Enterprise is hosted in the cloud and designed 
      for flexibility and reliability. States manage the Medicaid Enterprise as a cloud-based platform.
  level5:
    name: Optimized
    description: >
      The enterprise is fully composable, enabling dynamic orchestration of services and seamless 
      integration with broader human services (e.g., SNAP, TANF, and behavioral health). The Medicaid 
      Enterprise is cloud-native and serverless, ensuring resilience and scalability across the nation. 
      A zero-trust architecture is fully implemented; compliance is continuous and automated. The state 
      manages a next-generation, adaptive Medicaid enterprise.
