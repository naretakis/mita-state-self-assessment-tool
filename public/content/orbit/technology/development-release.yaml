  Development and Release maturity criteria assess code and configuration management, 
  testing and release practices, and security/compliance integration.

overallLevels:
  level1:
    name: Initial
    description: >
      Development and release processes are manual, inconsistent, and reactive. Code changes are 
      not version controlled, testing is ad hoc, and security is addressed after deployment. 
      No formal governance or automation.
  level2:
    name: Developing
    description: >
      Basic tools and practices are introduced, such as version control and environment separation. 
      Some testing and security practices are piloted, but processes remain siloed and inconsistently 
      applied. Releases are still largely manual.
  level3:
    name: Defined
    description: >
      Development and release processes are standardized and documented. Automated testing and IaC 
      are introduced. Security and compliance checks are integrated into the development lifecycle. 
      Releases follow defined gates.
  level4:
    name: Managed
    description: >
      Standard practices and approaches (e.g., CI/CD pipelines) are used to automate builds, tests, 
      and deployments. Code and infrastructure changes are peer reviewed and traceable. Security 
      gates and rollback mechanisms are embedded. Release metrics are tracked and used for improvement.
  level5:
    name: Optimized
    description: >
      Development and release are continuous, adaptive, and policy driven. AI/ML supports test 
      optimization, anomaly detection, and predictive compliance. The entire pipeline is monitored 
      in real time, enabling rapid, secure, and resilient delivery of changes.
