  Application Architecture maturity criteria assess modular architecture, user interfaces, 
  and session/state management capabilities.

overallLevels:
  level1:
    name: Initial
    description: >
      Medicaid systems are monolithic and tightly coupled, with limited ability to scale, replace, 
      or integrate components. User interfaces are inconsistent and inaccessible, and session 
      management is unreliable or nonexistent. There is no architectural governance or reuse.
  level2:
    name: Developing
    description: >
      Some modules or services are isolated and piloted, but integration and reuse are limited. 
      User interfaces begin to adopt responsive design and accessibility guidelines. Session 
      handling is basic and inconsistent across systems. Architecture decisions are ad hoc.
  level3:
    name: Defined
    description: >
      Systems are modularized with standardized APIs and service contracts. UI components are 
      consistent and accessible, and session state is maintained across modules. Architecture 
      is documented and aligned with CMS interoperability standards.
  level4:
    name: Managed
    description: >
      Modular architecture is governed and reused across the enterprise. Interfaces are mobile-first, 
      role-based, and tested for accessibility. Session and state are centrally managed and secure. 
      Architecture supports scalability, monitoring, and DevOps integration.
  level5:
    name: Optimized
    description: >
      The architecture is fully composable, adaptive, and event driven. Interfaces are personalized 
      and continuously improved using analytics. Session and state management is intelligent, 
      context-aware, and resilient across devices and channels. Architecture enables rapid innovation 
      and seamless integration with external systems.
