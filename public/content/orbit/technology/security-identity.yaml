  Security and Identity maturity criteria assess identity and access services, consent management, 
  system and data protection, and security monitoring capabilities.

overallLevels:
  level1:
    name: Initial
    description: >
      Security controls are dispersed without oversight. Multiple identity management systems may 
      be in place. Minimal capabilities to manage and use member consent. Lack of visibility to 
      security protections across the enterprise. Limited and siloed monitoring.
  level2:
    name: Developing
    description: >
      Some consolidation of identity management systems. Member consent management is in place. 
      Consent management is in place, but some processes such as revoking consent are manual. 
      Standards exist for security protection and monitoring, but are not fully implemented. 
      Some applications use standalone identity management systems.
  level3:
    name: Defined
    description: >
      Consent management in place. Security protections are defined and implemented for most systems. 
      SIEM tool used on most systems. Single identity management system used by all applications.
  level4:
    name: Managed
    description: >
      Consent management is in place. Security controls are standardized, implemented, and meet state 
      and federal regulations. Internal audits are used to validate compliance. A single SIEM tool 
      provides view of enterprise security events.
  level5:
    name: Optimized
    description: >
      The architecture is fully composable, adaptive, and event driven. Interfaces are personalized 
      and continuously improved using analytics. Session and state management is intelligent, 
      context-aware, and resilient across devices and channels. Architecture enables rapid innovation 
      and seamless integration with external systems.
