  Infrastructure maturity criteria assess compute and hosting, storage, networking, 
  and resilience/scaling capabilities.

overallLevels:
  level1:
    name: Initial
    description: >
      The infrastructure is legacy bound, primarily on-premises, with minimal virtualization 
      or automation. Networking is flat and insecure, storage is unmanaged, and resilience is 
      reactive. There is no formal governance, monitoring, or scaling capability.
  level2:
    name: Developing
    description: >
      The state begins adopting virtualization and piloting cloud services for non-critical 
      workloads. Basic security and backup policies are introduced. Networking is segmented, 
      and Disaster Recovery (DR) plans exist but are untested. Governance roles are emerging, 
      but practices are inconsistent.
  level3:
    name: Defined
    description: >
      A hybrid cloud model is in place with standardized provisioning and container adoption. 
      Storage is tiered and policy driven. Secure, segmented networking supports external partners. 
      DR is tested, and auto-scaling is implemented for some workloads. Technical debt is tracked, 
      and observability is established.
  level4:
    name: Managed
    description: >
      The infrastructure is governed by a cloud-first policy, with container orchestration, 
      Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), and integrated monitoring. Storage and networking are 
      optimized for performance, cost, and compliance. DR and scaling are automated and aligned 
      with business KPIs. Zero-trust principles are emerging.
  level5:
    name: Optimized
    description: >
      The infrastructure is fully cloud native, composable, and adaptive. Serverless and edge 
      computing are used where appropriate. AI/ML supports predictive scaling, anomaly detection, 
      and self-healing. Zero-trust networking and continuous compliance are fully implemented. 
      Governance is dynamic and data driven.
