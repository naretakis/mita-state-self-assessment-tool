  Platform Services maturity criteria assess application hosting, business rules and workflow 
  management, and common platform functions.

overallLevels:
  level1:
    name: Initial
    description: >
      Applications are hosted in environments lacking platform standards or strategy. Hosting uses 
      dedicated servers or virtual machines with limited scaling capability. There is very little 
      automation of platform services. Commonly used services such as document management workflow, 
      rules management, and address validation, are deployed independently when they are needed.
  level2:
    name: Developing
    description: >
      Applications are hosted in environments using standards for platform capabilities. Hosting 
      primarily uses virtual servers. The platform supports use of APIs and integration with COTS 
      tools and SaaS services. Business rules and workflow capabilities are restricted to limited 
      business functions. Common services are used for a single module within a single vendor or 
      state environment.
  level3:
    name: Defined
    description: >
      Platforms include PaaS services such as databases, application containers, API security, and 
      network integration. The platform uses SaaS and leveraged COTS tools for business capabilities 
      such as workflow, rules-based processing, and document management. Common services are leveraged 
      across modules but within the domain of a single vendor or state environment.
  level4:
    name: Managed
    description: >
      PaaS services are the primary hosting platform. The platforms are designed and implemented using 
      standards to limit complexity and to support automation. Commonly used business and technical 
      capabilities are implemented using SaaS and COTS tools. Some tools are available across vendor 
      and state hosting environments using APIs.
  level5:
    name: Optimized
    description: >
      Platforms are based almost exclusively on PaaS services. Platform standards include integration 
      with operations management. APIs are used to manage hosting including automated scaling. Most 
      services used across modules and environments are available from a common source although modules 
      may use their own capabilities.
