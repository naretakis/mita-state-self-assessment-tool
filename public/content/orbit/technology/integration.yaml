  Integration maturity criteria assess API and interface management, system messaging, 
  and external partner integration capabilities.

overallLevels:
  level1:
    name: Initial
    description: >
      The interfaces are single purpose with minimal use of data standards and no documentation. 
      There is little to no oversight. System messages are not exchanged or consolidated. 
      Partner integrations are lacking consistency.
  level2:
    name: Developing
    description: >
      Interface patterns and data standards are developed for reuse. New and updated interfaces 
      are subject to oversight and require documentation. Systems exchange some messages, but 
      exchanges lack standards. Partner integration patterns are under development.
  level3:
    name: Defined
    description: >
      New interface designs are based on reuse and data standards. Governance and documentation 
      standards are in place. Patterns for exchanging messages between systems are in place. 
      External partner integration follows standard processes and design.
  level4:
    name: Managed
    description: >
      Software frameworks are widely used and there is extensive interface reuse. Data standards 
      are applied to interfaces and interface specifications are published. Messages for critical 
      information are exchanged across systems using standard patterns and tools. Eliminating 
      variation of partner integration and automating endpoint management.
  level5:
    name: Optimized
    description: >
      Single use interfaces are eliminated. Interfaces follow patterns and implement data standards. 
      Specifications are published using API management tools. Systems exchange messages using tools 
      that trigger alerts when needed and track problems through to resolution. Partner integration 
      is standardized, and endpoints are continually monitored.
