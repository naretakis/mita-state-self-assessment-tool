# Archived Capability Files

These capability YAML files were used in the legacy content model where each capability area had its own dedicated file with custom maturity criteria.

## Why Archived?

With the adoption of the MITA 4.0 ORBIT maturity model, all capabilities now use standardized maturity criteria defined in the `OrbitMaturityService`. The capability metadata (domain, area, description) is now sourced entirely from `index.yaml`.

## Files

- `provider-enrollment.yaml` - Provider Enrollment capability (legacy format)
- `provider-management.yaml` - Provider Management capability (legacy format)  
- `provider-termination.yaml` - Provider Termination capability (legacy format)

## Migration Date

January 2026

## Reference

See `instructions/ORBIT_MATURITY_MODEL_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for details on the ORBIT model implementation.
