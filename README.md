## Available Scripts

- `npm run format`: Format code with Prettier
- `npm run format:check`: Check formatting without making changes
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint to check code quality
- `npm run lint:fix`: Automatically fix ESLint issues
- `npm run lint:report`: Generate a JSON report of linting issues
- `npm test`: Run all tests
- `npm run test:watch`: Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:coverage`: Generate test coverage report
- `npm run dev`: Start the development server
- `npm run build`: Build the application for production
- `npm run check`: Run formatting checks, linting, tests, and build verification
- `npm start`: Start the production server
- `npm run export`: Export the application as static HTML

## Development Workflow

1. **Branch Management**:
   - `main`: Production branch
   - `dev`: Development branch
   - `test`: Testing branch
   - Feature branches should be created from `dev`

2. **Code Style**:
   - Follow the ESLint and Prettier configurations
   - Run `npm run check` before committing
   - VS Code users: Install recommended extensions for automatic formatting:
     - ESLint (dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
     - Prettier (esbenp.prettier-vscode)

3. **Testing**:
   - Write tests for new features and bug fixes using Jest
   - Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request
   - Note: E2E tests are currently placeholders and will require Playwright or Cypress setup for actual implementation

4. **Pull Requests**:
   - Create pull requests against the `dev` branch
   - Include a description of changes and related issues
   - Ensure CI checks pass before merging

## Deployment

The application is deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions:

### GitHub Actions Workflow

A workflow file (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) handles automated deployment with multi-branch support:

- **Triggers**: Runs on pushes to `main`, `dev`, and `test` branches
- **Content preservation**: Downloads existing site content before deployment to preserve all environments
- **Branch-specific builds**: Each branch builds with the correct base path configuration
- **Single deployment target**: All branches deploy to the same GitHub Pages site but in different directories

### Setup Instructions

1. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to repository Settings > Pages
   - Set the source to "GitHub Actions"

2. **Configure Next.js**:
   - The `next.config.js` file is already configured to use the correct base paths
   - Environment variables set in the workflow control the base path for each branch

3. **Branch Management**:
   - Push to `main` for production updates
   - Push to `dev` for development environment updates
   - Push to `test` for testing environment updates

4. **Accessing Deployments**:
   - Each environment is accessible at its respective URL
   - The workflow preserves all environments during each deployment

## ContentService Structure

The application includes a ContentService that loads capability definitions from markdown files and provides methods to access them by ID or domain. The capability definitions are parsed using the capabilityParser utility.

## Browser Storage

The application uses browser storage for data persistence:

- **localStorage**: For long-term storage of assessment data
- **sessionStorage**: For temporary session data
- **indexedDB**: For larger datasets and offline capabilities, implemented using the idb library

The application includes a StorageService that provides a unified API for database operations and a useStorageAvailability hook that checks for storage availability and provides appropriate fallbacks.

## Performance Optimizations

The application includes several performance optimizations:

- **Code Splitting**: Dynamic imports for better loading performance
- **Image Optimization**: Progressive loading with placeholders
- **Caching Strategies**: In-memory caching with TTL
- **Webpack Optimizations**: Custom chunk splitting for optimal loading
- **Browser Storage**: Efficient local data persistence

## Accessibility

The application follows accessibility best practices:

- Uses semantic HTML elements
- Implements proper ARIA attributes
- Ensures keyboard navigation
- Maintains sufficient color contrast
- Integrates with CMS Design System for accessible components
