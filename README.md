   - Feature branches should be created from `dev`

2. **Code Style**:
   - Follow the ESLint and Prettier configurations
   - Run `npm run check` before committing
   - VS Code users: Install recommended extensions for automatic formatting:
     - ESLint (dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
     - Prettier (esbenp.prettier-vscode)

3. **Testing**:
   - Write tests for new features and bug fixes using Jest
   - Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request
   - Note: E2E tests are currently placeholders and will require Playwright or Cypress setup for actual implementation

4. **Pull Requests**:
   - Create pull requests against the `dev` branch
   - Include a description of changes and related issues
   - Ensure CI checks pass before merging

## Deployment

The application uses a robust multi-branch deployment system to GitHub Pages with complete environment isolation:

### Multi-Branch Deployment Architecture

The deployment system supports three completely isolated environments:
- **Production** (`main` branch): [https://naretakis.github.io/mita-state-self-assessment-tool/](https://naretakis.github.io/mita-state-self-assessment-tool/)
- **Development** (`dev` branch): [https://naretakis.github.io/mita-state-self-assessment-tool/dev/](https://naretakis.github.io/mita-state-self-assessment-tool/dev/)
- **Testing** (`test` branch): [https://naretakis.github.io/mita-state-self-assessment-tool/test/](https://naretakis.github.io/mita-state-self-assessment-tool/test/)

### GitHub Actions Workflow Features

The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` workflow provides:

- **Automatic Deployment**: Triggers on pushes to `main`, `dev`, and `test` branches
- **Environment Isolation**: Each branch deploys to its own subdirectory with proper base path configuration
- **Content Preservation**: Intelligent preservation of existing deployments when building other branches
- **Artifact Management**: Uses GitHub Actions artifacts with fallback to live site downloading for reliability
- **Branch-Specific Configuration**: Each environment builds with correct base paths and asset prefixes
- **Concurrent Deployment Protection**: Prevents deployment conflicts with proper concurrency controls

### Deployment Process

1. **Content Preservation**: Downloads existing site content to preserve all environments
2. **Branch Detection**: Automatically detects which branch is being deployed
3. **Environment-Specific Build**: Builds with correct base path (`/mita-state-self-assessment-tool`, `/mita-state-self-assessment-tool/dev`, or `/mita-state-self-assessment-tool/test`)
4. **Selective Deployment**: Only updates the target environment while preserving others
5. **Asset Optimization**: Ensures proper routing and asset loading for each environment

### Setup Instructions

1. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to repository Settings > Pages
   - Set the source to "GitHub Actions"

2. **Next.js Configuration**:
   - `next.config.js` automatically configures base paths based on environment variables
   - `_document.tsx` sets correct base href for each environment
   - Static export configuration optimized for GitHub Pages

3. **Branch Management**:
   - Push to `main` for production updates
   - Push to `dev` for development environment updates  
   - Push to `test` for testing environment updates
   - Each push automatically deploys to its respective environment

4. **Environment Access**:
   - All environments remain accessible simultaneously
   - No cross-environment interference or downtime during deployments
   - Each environment functions independently with proper routing

### Technical Implementation

- **Base Path Handling**: Dynamic base path configuration based on deployment environment
- **Asset Path Resolution**: Proper asset prefix configuration for subdirectory deployments
- **Client-Side Routing**: Custom 404.html handling for SPA routing in subdirectories
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Robust fallback from artifact download to live site preservation
- **Deployment Verification**: Comprehensive logging and debugging for deployment troubleshooting

## ContentService Structure

The application includes a ContentService that loads capability definitions from markdown files and provides methods to access them by ID or domain. The capability definitions are parsed using the capabilityParser utility.

## Browser Storage

The application uses browser storage for data persistence:

- **localStorage**: For long-term storage of assessment data
- **sessionStorage**: For temporary session data
- **indexedDB**: For larger datasets and offline capabilities, implemented using the idb library

The application includes a StorageService that provides a unified API for database operations and a useStorageAvailability hook that checks for storage availability and provides appropriate fallbacks.

## Performance Optimizations

The application includes several performance optimizations:

- **Code Splitting**: Dynamic imports for better loading performance
- **Image Optimization**: Progressive loading with placeholders
- **Caching Strategies**: In-memory caching with TTL
- **Webpack Optimizations**: Custom chunk splitting for optimal loading
- **Browser Storage**: Efficient local data persistence

## Accessibility

The application follows accessibility best practices:

- Uses semantic HTML elements
- Implements proper ARIA attributes
- Ensures keyboard navigation
- Maintains sufficient color contrast
- Integrates with CMS Design System for accessible components
