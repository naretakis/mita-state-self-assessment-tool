## Welcome & Introduction

Thank you for participating in this focus group testing session! Your feedback is invaluable in helping us improve the MITA State Self-Assessment Tool. This guide will walk you through specific tasks and scenarios to test the application's functionality and user experience.

### What We're Testing

- Clarity of instructions and guidance
- Usability of text input fields for content entry
- Results page presentation and data export
- General user experience and pain points
- Features you wish the application had

### What We're NOT Testing
- Actual MITA definitions or language (everything in the tool right now is placeholder data)
- Accessibility (We have built the tool with WCAG2.1 in mind, but we're not doing accessibility testing at this time)

### Time Commitment
- **Hour 1 (Required):** Core functionality testing (~60 minutes)
- **Hour 2 (Optional):** Extended testing and exploration (~60 minutes)

### How to Provide Feedback
Throughout this guide, you'll find rating scales (1-5) and open-ended questions. There are no wrong answers, if something is confusing or strange it is probably confusing or strange to everyone. 

**Rating Scale:**
- 1 = Very Poor/Very Difficult
- 2 = Poor/Difficult
- 3 = Acceptable/Neutral
- 4 = Good/Easy
- 5 = Excellent/Very Easy
